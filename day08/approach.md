# Day 8

Note: this was done as catch-up on Day 8

## Part 1

This was simple with a new 'vector' addition method for `IntPair`

## Part 2

Noticed the problem stated 'harmonic', which I immediately assumed to mean 'integer multiples' so I did not consider the case where non-integer multiples of the vector might also cause a valid antinode. Luckily it appeared that the components of the vectors are coprime, so this did not matter.
